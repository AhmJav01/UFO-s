## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to learn how to use Javascript and html to create an interactive website that consists of a data table, images, a search/ input feature, and different text styles.

## Results
As seen in Image 2, there are five search criteria a user can input in order to get more information about any UFO sightings they might have seen, or are interested in:
* Date: refers to the date of the UFO sighting in MM/DD/YYYY form
* City: The name of the city where the the sight was located
* State: the name of the state where the sight was located
* Country: the name of the country where the sight was located
* Shape: the assumed shape of the UFO in the sighting

Users can fill out 1 -5 search criteria in order to find out about UFO sightings in a certain location, date, or of UFO's of a certain shape.
When users input their data in the search bar, the website will show an output of the search criteria, as well as additional comments, as shown in Image 3

## Summary
One drawback of the the new design is that users may type locations of the cities or countries incorreclty, so they might not get the desired results they want.
Two recommendations for the website are:
1. Add a time section or an AM/PM filter to allow people to be more precises with their UFO spotting
2. If images of the sightings are available, they could be added to the website to help the user confirm if that was the sighting they were referring to
